    Bamboozled grabs build results from an Atlassian Bamboo server,
    and re-publishes them in "cc.xml" format, making them available
    to tools like "CCMenu" and "CCTray".

    Just point your CCMenu/CCTray at:

      <%= url("/${bamboo_host_of_your_choice}/cc.xml") %>

    where ${bamboo_host_of_your_choice} is a Bamboo host of your choice.
